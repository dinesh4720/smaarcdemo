      "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analytics plays a very important role in all industries and business sectors</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. From medical to educational to even a small shopkeeper, collecting and analyzing data is something that can&rsquo;t be ignored. Let us try and understand what analytics is or what analytics means? In general definition, Analytics is the process of examining and analyzing data or statistics for the discovery, interpretation and communication of meaningful patterns in data. These data patterns are applied towards effective decision making. The importance of analytics in manufacturing is as relevant as how customers are to buyers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturing Analytics is the proper use by gathering data from operations and events in the industry, analyzing it with the help of the advanced technologies such as, cloud-computing, digital twin, machine learning, AI, etc to ensure quality, increased performance and yield, reduced cost, and optimize supply chain. Manufacturing analytics is a part of the smart manufacturing sector which comes under the huge umbrella; Industry 4.0. It relies upon predictive analysis, big data analytics, the IoT, machine learning, and edge computing to enable smarter, scalable factory solutions. In short, Manufacturing Analytics is the collection and analysis of data from an unlimited number of sources to help manufacturing companies increase the productivity and profitability of their operations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturing analytics provides access to manufacturers on the real-time contextual awareness, and thus gives decision makers a competitive edge by digitizing the business, optimizing costs, improving quality, accelerating innovations, and redefining customer experience. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the conversion from data into insights into actions. That is, the analytics helps in identifying the business use cases (which include, supply chain, product quality, field service and support, creating an efficient factory), assembles the data which are collected from the factory floor, connected sensors and devices, the data for suppliers, sales, processes, equipment, etc. The assembled data is then put together, merged, cleansed, filtered, and prepared for analysis. The analyzed data helps to start the automation process and creates&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">applications for real-time monitoring and dashboards, it also looks for signals that indicate defects, cycle time, production yield and other parameters and push-out alerts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"./assets/images/blog/impofanalytics-01.png\" alt=\"N.A\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rise in industrial automation in manufacturing, increased complexities in the supply chain, and growing demand for software systems that reduce time and cost. The current global manufacturing analytics market size is about $6 billion, which is predicted to reach $28.5 billion by 2026.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"./assets/images/blog/impofanalytics-02.png\" alt=\"N.A\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturing Analytics is a key factor in maintaining and conducting proper <a href=\"https://lincode.ai/blog.php?id=6&amp;utm_source=blog16\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quality assurance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at all stages of production. It helps in improving the quality of an end-product and increasing the production yield through anomaly detection. By adding the huge chunks of data collected from sensors, devices and AI visual inspection software within a powerful cloud-based manufacturing analytics platform, quality can be controlled at the micro level. Data science and advanced manufacturing analytics make it possible for this process to be simulated. Choosing the right solution for manufacturing analytics and quality checks includes many factors. For example, the </span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software provided by Lincode for quality inspection, LIVIS, is a cost-effective, AI-based, easily deployable solution that collects and analyzes data to inspect the product and check for defects in less than a second.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.latentview.com/blog/analytics-in-manufacturing-current-trends-and-opportunities/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.latentview.com/blog/analytics-in-manufacturing-current-trends-and-opportunities/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://aimpointdigital.com/data-manufacturing/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://aimpointdigital.com/data-manufacturing/</span></a> </span></p>",

      "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">End-of-line (EOL) inspection is one of the most crucial parts of the manufacturing process. It is the final opportunity for the manufacturers to check to ensure that the final product handed over to the buyer or the customer has zero defects. Carrying out a highly efficient inspection helps the company reduce the return rate and thus increase the ROI. At this stage of inspection, a 100 percent precision criterion is deployed so as to make sure that no defective pieces leave the manufacturing company. EOL inspection is, in short, a visual check of specifications, defects, aesthetics. presence and absence of child parts, optical character recognition (OCR) and others on the final product.</span></p>\n<p>EOL inspection is crucial in every industry, be it automotive, aerospace, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, textiles, or any other. It's equally important for tier 1 companies and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). For the former, it's important for them to make sure that the products handed over to their buyer are defect-free. Maintaining an upper hand in the quality of products helps them keep their buyers within the range. When it comes to OEMs, the EOL inspection is highly crucial as they are the ones who are directly contacting or dealing with the final customers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, let's take an example from the automotive industry. If a car company gives out a dozen defective cars, the company or brand will suffer a huge loss of customer trust, market value, and hence a steep decline in terms of revenue.</p>\n<p>Manufacturers have started implementing EOL inspections into their line of manufacturing process. Among them, companies exposed to AI-powered visual inspection systems are experiencing the greatest advantages, such as increased rate of defect detection by up to 90 percent ; 98+ percent accuracy and efficiency in the line of quality inspection, and a 10x increased ROI. As manufacturers start to realize the benefits of AI in their processes, predictions say that AI in the manufacturing market will grow to US$11bn by 2025 at a CAGR of 54.6%.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the AI powered visual inspection system work?</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure quality for the complex and final products, manufacturers have to implement a solution that can detect defects as per the required tolerance for each parameter for different products and segregate them from the non-defective ones. Compared to traditional vision systems, AI-powered vision systems are far more advanced. They can perform tasks that are lacking by traditional systems, such as not being able to detect defects because they aren't taught to the system, changes in the orientation, shape, and size etc. Apart from looking for the presence and absence of child parts or major defects, <a href=\"./blog.php?id=10\" target=\"_blank\">AI vision systems</a> can perform deeper and wider tasks in milliseconds.</p>\n<p>One other advantage of AI vision systems is that they are easy to deploy and are cost effective.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LIVIS is one such hardware-agnostic artificial intelligence-based software that can be deployed in less than a month. Automated data training and model deployment, API integration with factory systems are few among the major user-friendly features of LIVIS . In comparison to existing competitors in the market, LIVIS has an upper hand with its added competitive advantages.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>The number of parameters to be checked during an EOL inspection will vary with the products; so will the specification, such as tolerance, size, severity of the defects, dents, scratches, measurements, proper alignment etc. LIVIS can carry out a 360&deg; inspection of a product and check for any number of parameters at the same time, reducing the cycle time to half or even one by tenth of the usual time taken to inspect.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accuracy, precision, efficiency and reduced cycle time are the major lookouts for an end-of-line visual inspection system. In this era of Industry 4.0, and high competition, embracing smart manufacturing and implementing the perfect solution for a focused approach to EOL inspection will be the smartest thing to do for any manufacturing company.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Sources</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Towards Data Science</span></em></em></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturing Global</span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of a 4.0 is not a new one. Industry 4.0 has been in place for some time, and Aerospace 4.0 is a part of this next industrial revolution.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How important will Aerospace 4.0 be, and how will it enable the industry to evolve?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aerospace 4.0 essentially applies to all the new digital technologies entering the manufacturing industry but through the lens of the aerospace sector. These new advancements incorporate Big Data, 3D printing, edge registering, expanded reality, computerized reasoning, AI, and the Internet of Aircraft Things, IoAT. Aircraft manufacturers, Suppliers, and OEMs need to remain up to date to contend in the worldwide market. To accomplish that, they should foster items quicker, less expensive, and better. The best way to guarantee that is achievable is to accept the new advanced technologies that Aerospace 4.0 brings to the table.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to this new revolution, Aircraft manufacturers and suppliers had issues providing data back to the product&rsquo;s design, maintenance, and manufacturing processes autonomously and in real-time, and from all parts of the value chain - including in-service data. The present digitalized innovations guarantee product life cycle information is accessible progressively, is versatile, streamlined, and permits organizations to stay away from previous issues and move to a more powerful method of working that fulfills time constraints and client satisfaction. The parts that structure Aerospace 4.0 will empower organizations to reduce costs, improve quality, cut down inventory, up productivity, limit defects, improve time to market, and expand the chance to present new inventories.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adhering to Aerospace 4.0 has a lot of advantages and is not just limited to the above. Design iterations, data analytics, and certification are few key areas the Aircraft manufacturers and suppliers can&rsquo;t even think of compromising in terms of quality or any other aspects. Even a small squander in these areas can cost a fortune. And therefore, these areas need extra care and the help of advanced technologies to ensure smooth functioning.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Cutting down the iterations</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One specific area where digital technologies can have a significant impact is the reduction of design iterations for new product developments. Design iterations can be costly, especially in aerospace. Much of the time and cost of a new product launch is in the effort to qualify the product on actual airframes. Once this qualification starts, additional design changes are difficult to make, as they may drive a costly re-qualification process. Building in the knowledge from a robust information store as to how prior products have fared in the field provides invaluable knowledge. This empowers the design team to ensure that the design that goes out for qualification is the right design.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Data analytics is the key</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, manufacturers have a real-time view of each part of the process. This helps to minimize downtime and establish real-time feedback and testing at every stage of the production process. The constant visibility into the production status means that no time or resources are wasted as testing takes place during each section of the production process and not only at the end. This is all aided by data analytics which allows for data to be fed back to a control system. This enables more precise and real-time decision-making. The technology adds value to the production line process, and it is easier, and cheaper, to address a problem pro-actively rather than when it&rsquo;s much more costly to remediate.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Relevance of certification</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Particularly important in the aerospace industry is certification. The consequence of the failure of structures on aircraft is markedly higher than that of other industries therefore regulation and certification must be rigorous. The challenge to aerospace manufacturing is twofold. Firstly, the designers and the certifying bodies must be satisfied that digital technology can consistently produce acceptable parts and be able to detect when parts are not acceptable. Secondly, new automated manufacturing techniques must not produce new residual stresses that may not have been seen before. These risks can be mitigated with simulation, but simulation techniques must be validated. 90% of any such defects can be detected using advanced AI-powered surface defect detection systems. AI visual inspection systems can be customized according to the needs of the manufacturer, it can not only detect surface defects such as paint defects, composite surface defects, Foreign Object Detection (FOD) but also look for missing hardware, for example, rivets, bolts, bolt-head missing, nuts which are small in size but are relevant.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aerospace 4.0 is set to change the way the industry operates. New digital technologies will enhance manufacturing operations by saving time and money. They will aid the creation of new, ground-breaking products. It is of paramount importance that companies working in the aerospace sector embrace and adopt digital technologies to stay relevant and keep up with other markets. Aerospace 4.0 impacts not only the operations side of the business but the user experience as well. From enabling and improving the capabilities of a &lsquo;connected aircraft&rsquo; that allows for customized entertainment options for the passengers from take-off to touch-down to the ability to have real-time data analytics for the crew to ensure continued safety throughout the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flight, the ability to connect data and platforms will allow for experiences and dependability previously unthought-of in the aerospace industry. Aerospace 4.0 is no longer a desire, but a necessity.</span></p>",

      "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First it was disinfecting products, then it was toilet paper, then came the flour shortage. Now it is lumber, and microchips for cars and on it goes. The point is that there are many shortages and supply chain issues nearly 18 months after the pandemic caused massive shutdowns and disruptions. For manufacturers, these disruptions created tremendous challenges to be as flexible as possible while still producing quality products. But incredible opportunities for technology adoption were also created.</span></p>\n<p>It has been 10 years since Industry 4.0 was first introduced as a concept by a German consortium to enhance the country&rsquo;s competitiveness in the manufacturing industry. The fourth industrial revolution was defined as the automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, and was intended to take manufacturing processes to a new level. But the barriers proved to be daunting, and what was touted as a revolution, turned into more of a slow evolution.</p>\n<p>AI facilitates to conquer many internal challenges that have been around in the industry: from expertise shortage to complexity in decision making, issues related to integration, and overloaded information. Making use of AI in manufacturing plants enables businesses to completely transform their proceedings. Let&rsquo;s have a glance at how AI is helping the manufacturing sector to accomplish:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Directed Automation:</strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The utilisation of AI and robots is particularly observed in industrial manufacturing as they revolutionize mass-production. Robots are capable of doing recurring activities, designing the production model, rising competence, building automation solutions, eradicating human error and delivering superior levels of quality assurance.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>24x7&nbsp; Production:</strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While humans are forced to work in 3 shifts to ensure continuous production, while robots are capable of working 24/7 in the production line. Businesses can be witnessed to expand in terms of production capabilities and meet the high demand of customers worldwide.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Safer Operational Environment:</strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With several errors taking place on the manufacturing plant, a step towards AI means less human resources have to carry out dangerous and overly laborious work. As robots replace humans and perform normal and risky activities, the number of workplace accidents will decrease all across.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Novel Opportunities for Humans:</strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As AI takes over the manufacturing plant and automates boring and ordinary human tasks, workers will get to focus on complex and innovative tasks. While AI takes care of unskilled labor, humans can focus on driving innovation and routing their business to advanced levels.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Condensed Operating Costs:</strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although bringing AI onto the manufacturing industry would necessitate a huge capital investment, the ROI is significantly high. As intelligent machines start taking care of day-to-day-activities, businesses can enjoy considerably lower operating costs.</span></p>\n<h4><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h4>\n<p>AI&rsquo;s proponents claim that the technology is only an evolutionary form of automation, a predictable result of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. AI may be efficient at creating things, improving them, and making them cheaper. But there is no replacement for human ingenuity in dealing with the unanticipated changes in tastes and demands&mdash;or in deciding whether to make things at all.</p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>",

      "body":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A study found that AI-driven quality testing can increase productivity by up to 50% and defect detection rates by up to 90% compared to human inspection. Though machines with automated optical inspection (AOI), powered by machine vision, have replaced most of the manual processes in the modern assembly line, quality control still remains a huge and costly challenge. The critical limitation with machine learning AOI systems is in disclosing surface defects where even a slight variant can hamper the entire production run and render hundreds to thousands of products useless before the defect is discovered. The economic impact can be devastating.</span></p>\n<p>Machine learning systems rely on vision smart cameras to autonomously scan devices to test for failures and defects. However, when it comes to high-transparency objects, such as smooth and metal surfaces, the rule-based algorithms of general machine learning-based AOI systems are hard to apply, and thus, inspection on these types of objects still relies on humans, causing lower production throughput. Machine learning AOI systems depend on fixed geometric algorithms to discover defects, but acquiring quality images from high-transparency objects often results in unacceptable inspection performance.To do this, the machine learning algorithms of AOI must work in concert with deep learning algorithms. By adding deep learning, another subset of AI to the AOI process, the defect detection process can be significantly improved.</p>\n<p><strong>Deep Learning for AOI</strong></p>\n<p>Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Unlike machine learning training, deep learning training can be conducted without explicit programming, requiring no human supervision. The precision of deep learning hinges not only on the algorithm but more importantly on the data and its quality. Only with a sufficient amount of high-quality data can the model training results be accurate.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With AI, machine learning and deep learning residing at the edge, data can be recorded to analyze issues during the production process as the reference to adjust the manufacturing parameters to&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improve the yield rate and increase the overall equipment effectiveness. The very autonomous learning nature of deep learning allows one to conduct predictive analyses and reach error-free, flawless production.</span></p>\n<p>In a recent case study, an edge computing company teamed up with an AI software company.&nbsp; Their goal was to help a contact lens manufacturer enhance its production precision. The first step was to address this issue by first introducing a machine vision system that gathered digital data to develop AI algorithms. In its early development stage, the machine learning inspection system learned from humans by having the AI system operate alongside experienced human inspectors who corrected and marked the mistakes the AI system made. The approach allowed the system to develop rules and logics of a deep learning algorithm, while accumulating adequate data for the system directly from the production line to keep improving its precision with deep training.</p>\n<p><strong>How does AI-enabled Solution Works</strong></p>\n<p>To build a smart inspection solution, AI software can be combined with a machine vision platform, which supports a wide variety of deep learning applications. In addition, an appropriately-optimized toolkit can enable deep learning inference from edge to cloud.&nbsp; With this in place, automatic load balancing and asynchronous execution can deliver cost-effective performance, while heterogeneity support allows seamless execution across cloud and local servers and edge AI vision devices. This type of solution also collects data from inspection devices to train AI and iterate on inspection performance gains and maintains inspection logs for customer references.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>AI and AOI are supplementary. They take different, but equally critical inspection roles within AOI. By applying the subsets of AI to AOI, manufacturers can precisely tune production quality and reduce quality control efforts and operational costs on exponential levels.&nbsp;</p>",

When it comes to representing AI-based defects spotting solutions, it&rsquo;s often based on some kind of visual inspection technology that is substructured on deep learning and computer vision.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DEEP LEARNING IN A VISUAL INSPECTION</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us first understand the concept of deep learning. Deep learning is a technique of machine learning. It provides a solution for computers to process inputs through understanding the layers and learning on how to anticipate and classify information. And further inspection can be in the form of images, sound, or text.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The innovation of deep learning is the way that the human brain processes information. Its primary purpose is to imitate the fact that how the human brain works to create some real magic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking about the above point in further, the fundamental working guidelines of deep learning technology is purely based on teaching machines to learn by precedent. By delivering a safe network with categorized precedents of significant types of data, it&rsquo;s feasible to extract frequently used cases between those examples, and then convert it into a math equation. This process helps in classifying upcoming sources of information. And thus takes us into various aspects of visual inspection methods.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Incorporate AI-Based Visual Inspection System</span></h3>\n<h4><strong>1. State the Problem</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process of visual inspection often starts with a combination of applying business and technical inspection. The primary goal here is to examine what kind of defects the system should and can </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">determine</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Important questions we should consider including:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the visual inspection system conditions?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inspection should be done real-time or adjourned?&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How detailed should the visual inspection system detect, and should it differentiate them by type?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is there any current available software that incorporates the visual inspection characteristics, or does it require a formation from the base level?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should the system alert the user(s) about detected issues and if yes then how?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does the visual inspection system note the defects detection figures statistically?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data science engineers select the classic high tech resolution and flow to carry forward the inspection based on the answers they achieve.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>2. Collect &amp; Develop Data</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data science engineers should collect and develop data that is at first required to train an upcoming model before the further deep learning model formation starts. For various manufacturing techniques, it becomes pivotal to include IoT Data studies. Whenever we mention visual inspection models, the data is often considered to be the available video records, where the images are designed and incorporated by a visual inspection model including video frames. There are numerous options available for data collection, but the most popular ones are:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking an available video record generated by a client</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking one single open-source from video records that shall be applicable for designated purposes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collecting data from the base level from deep learning model requirements</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most potent variable here is the video record&rsquo;s worth value in terms of the quality. Higher quality data will ensure more specific outcomes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the data is collected, we can further prepare it for modeling, immaculate it, check it for anomalies, and advice on its authenticity.</span></p>\n<h4><strong>3. Evaluate&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The immediate next step post developing the visual inspection model is to evaluate it. Within this particular stage, the data scientists authenticate and further evaluate the execution and result authenticity of the model. For a proper visual inspection operating system, a set of video records that are either former or similar to ones we want to process after deployment can be used.</span></p>\n<h4><strong>4. Deploy &amp; Upgrade</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While deploying a visual inspection process, it&rsquo;s very potent to contemplate how both software and hardware systems communicate to a particular model capacity.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the type of industry and automation processes system, devices that are required for visual inspection system may include:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Camera - </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key camera option is real-time video streaming. Some examples include IP and CCTV.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Gateway - </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both dedicated hardware appliances and software programs work well for a visual inspection system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deep learning representations are formulated to improve the process after deployment. An effective deep learning perspective can increase the rate of the accuracy of the neural network with the support of the repetitive collection of new data and model re-training. The final result is a &ldquo;lucrative&rdquo; and advanced visual inspection model that learns through increased amounts of data during the operation process.</span></p>",

But, manufacturers must also be vigilant about the kind and amount of energy they use. For instance, automotive manufacturing consumes a lot of energy in converting the raw materials into automobile parts, then assembling the parts to produce an automobile. The manufacturer must evaluate alternative and eco-friendly energy systems like biomass, solar-thermal systems, wind energy systems, etc.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<ol style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\" start=\"2\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> 2.

However, due to the lack of current resource optimization, the manufacturer may incur unnecessary costs and may end up stocking resources that may not be needed; this creates a barrier in Sustainable Manufacturing. An act as simple as turning off the machine when not in use or envisioning and adhering to a timeline for the use of machine and equipment until it becomes obsolete will help the manufacturer in making optimal use of the current resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\" start=\"3\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> 3.

The defect only comes to light when, unfortunately, a customer spots it. AI detects micro defects such as a small scratch on plastic, a hole on the cloth, slightest of the color irregularities on automotives, etc. AI detects the defect with highest accuracy and precision.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.3800000000000001;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">#2 Analyzing the anomalies</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.3800000000000001;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">To rectify a defect, it is essential to know the source of the defect. &nbsp;AI analyzes the defects and ascertains where it comes from.

    "body": "<h1 class=\"mb-2\">Machine Vision VS AI Computer Vision</h1><div  style=\"color: black;\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What would the world be without manufacturing industries? The products we use in our daily lives; steel, fabric, plastic, pharmaceuticals, etc. are an outcome of an extensive manufacturing process. If there is a single glitch in the manufacturing process, the final product will lose its marketing standing; therefore, investing in technologies to monitor every stage of the manufacturing process is a necessity for every manufacturing industry today.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Machine Vision System</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Machine Vision technology was popularly used among all the major manufacturing industries, the technology could not keep up with the pace of increased customer expectation for product quality, due to the following limitations:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology used a golden template to detect surface defects and errors and was rigid towards image orientation; as a result, Machine Vision could only detect the obvious defects and could not capture the microscope defects.&nbsp;</span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine Vision required the installation of expensive hardware and had limited functionality&nbsp;</span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The training process and deployment cycles were time-intensive and costly&nbsp;</span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine Vision technology was not flexible to the manufacturer&rsquo;s change in requirements</span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturers of various industries now needed a technology, much stronger and better than Machine Vision system to scale-up the overall manufacturing process.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>AI-backed Computer Vision System</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-backed Computer Vision System has begun to disrupt all the major manufacturing industries. Manufacturers who augment their factories with AI-backed Computer Vision System have experienced the following advantages:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>Quality Assurance&nbsp;</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine vision&rsquo;s capability to capture microscopic defects is limited. Computer Vision takes multiple images of a product on full speed conveyors and effortlessly captures microscopic defects on various product surfaces irrespective of the image orientation, enabling the manufacturer to take corrective measures at the right time, enhancing the overall product quality.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>Reduction of operational costs</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here&rsquo;s an instance</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A steel manufacturer discovers that an entire batch of the product has minute chipped corners.

Imagine the loss of time, money, material, and efforts the manufacturer will have to bear to produce another batch, all over again!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI Computer Vision detects errors at the right time and saves the organization from spending a fortune on remediating measures. According to an interesting article, with the help of machine learning, Netflix managed to save&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USD 1 billion</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;in 2017!*</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>Shorter production cycles</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As production cycles get shorter, the production capacity becomes higher. When the production cycle is not bound to time and labor-intensive processes and is stringently monitored for defects and errors, the production cycle becomes faster and more efficient. Manufacturers can produce quality goods within a reasonable time frame and are ready to deliver them to the market just when the demand is at a peak.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>Improved employee productivity&nbsp;</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When manufacturers choose AI Computer Vision over the flawed Human Vision or Machine Vision, the manpower at the factory can be put to a better use. While AI Computer Vision accurately inspects the product for quality assurance, the laborers are spared from this strenuous process and can be employed in other processes of manufacturing that requires adequate human intervention.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Future of AI Computer Vision System</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AI in computer vision market was valued at USD 2.37 billion in 2017 and is expected to reach USD 25.32 billion by 2023, at a CAGR of 47.54% during the forecast period. 2017 has been considered as the base year, and the forecast period is from 2018 to 2023.*</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Lincode&rsquo;s AI Computer Vision Solution&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lincode&rsquo;s AI Visual Inspection System is a state-of-the-art, Industry 4.0 solution that enables manufacturers to identify surface defects, identify and measure individual components, and generate real-time data about products on the production line.
